01:004:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
           and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

01:004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
           sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

01:004:003 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of
           the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

01:004:004 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and
           of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to
           his offering:

01:004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain
           was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

01:004:006 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is
           thy countenance fallen?

01:004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
           doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be
           his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

01:004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,
           when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel
           his brother, and slew him.

01:004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
           said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

01:004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's
           blood crieth unto me from the ground.

01:004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
           mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

01:004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
           unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
           be in the earth.

01:004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I
           can bear.

01:004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
           earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
           fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to
           pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.

01:004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
           vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a
           mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

01:004:016 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in
           the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

01:004:017 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and
           he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
           name of his son, Enoch.

01:004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
           Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

01:004:019 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
           Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

01:004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in
           tents, and of such as have cattle.

01:004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
           such as handle the harp and organ.

01:004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every
           artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was
           Naamah.

01:004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my
           voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have
           slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

01:004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
           sevenfold.

01:004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called
           his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another
           seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

01:004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called
           his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the
           LORD.
