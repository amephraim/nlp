37:001:001 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
           the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by
           Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
           governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high
           priest, saying,

37:001:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The
           time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be
           built.

37:001:003 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

37:001:004 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and
           this house lie waste?

37:001:005 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your
           ways.

37:001:006 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have
           not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye
           clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages
           earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.

37:001:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

37:001:008 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house;
           and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith
           the LORD.

37:001:009 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye
           brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of
           hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every
           man unto his own house.

37:001:010 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the
           earth is stayed from her fruit.

37:001:011 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
           mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon
           the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and
           upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the
           hands.

37:001:012 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
           Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people,
           obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of
           Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and
           the people did fear before the LORD.

37:001:013 Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message
           unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.

37:001:014 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
           Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son
           of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the
           remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house
           of the LORD of hosts, their God,

37:001:015 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the
           second year of Darius the king.
